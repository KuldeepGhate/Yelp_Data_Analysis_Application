How can the reviews be 4-5 stars and the service at best \"average\", the food was terrible and myself and my co-workers all agreed, this restaurant doesn't rate two stars.\n\nI had one of the special Friday offerings, Smelt. It came with a salad (very average but fresh), fries (ordinary) and the Smelt. After a 20-25 minute wait our server came with our orders. I looked at my plate and was shocked! There was 12-15 so-called Smelt about 3\" long and deep fried. They looked like little fat cigarettes! I bit into one and it was all batter, I tried another and it was the same. I had deep fried batter for lunch!!\nI haven't had a meal this bad since I got out of the Navy! \n\n My co-workes meals were not much better, one had Chicken Fried Steak and he said it was made out of the box. My other co-worker had the Cod and he said it was mushy and brown colored! YUK! \n\nI hate to write such a negative review but this restaurant earned \"one\" star. Maybe they have great breakfast! I hope they do because their lunches are sub-par. \n\nThere are other restaurants on this street/highway, I'd give them a try before I stopped here. I know my co-workers and I won't be coming back.", "type": "review", "business_id": "uGykseHzyS5xAMWoN6YUqA"}

We weren't expecting much being not at our best either. \n\nThe service, as mentioned several times in yelp, is really slow. My drink was forgotten about and the next time our waitress came around she was serving our meal about 30-40 minutes from taking our order. The restaurant was probably half full of people. My boyfriends meal was mediocre \"at best\" as he put it but my meal was worse. My bacon and egg omelette was burnt and the cheese was scarce. \n\nAt the end of our meal, our server still charged us for the missing drink but they were kind enough to take it off the bill, that is while we waited 10 minutes standing at the register.

You can only have so much before you start getting that sickly feeling and start stirring that plastic spoon around and staring down the custard and wondering why you dont wanna finish.
